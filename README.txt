Shout out and Huge thanks to html5up.net | AJ aj@lkn.io | @ajlkn

Used this Free single page responsive template to create a Data Analytics portfolio under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
